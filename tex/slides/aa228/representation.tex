\begin{frame}[fragile]{Belief Representation}

Beliefs can be represented in different ways:
\begin{itemize}
    \pause \item \textbf{Parametric}: The belief distribution is represented by a set of parameters for a fixed distribution family
    \begin{itemize}
        \item E.g., Categorical distribution\footnote{A probability mass is assigned to each discrete category.} or multivariate normal (Gaussian) distribution
    \end{itemize}
    \pause \item \textbf{Non-parametric}: The belief distribution is represented by particles (or points sampled from the state space)
\end{itemize}

\vspace{5mm}
\pause Depending on the representation, different algorithms can be used to update beliefs.
