\textbf{Particle filter with rejection}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Used in problems with discrete observations.
    \item Any sampled observation that does not equal the true observation is rejected.
    \item Problem of \textit{particle deprivation}: lack of particles near the true state.\footnote{Due to low particle coverage given the stochastic nature of resampling.}
\end{itemize}

\vspace{5mm}
\textbf{Injection particle filter}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Inject random particles to protect against particle deprivation.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{5mm}
\textbf{Adaptive injection particle filter}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Inject particles adaptively based on a ratio of two exponentially moving averages of the mean particle weights (using \textit{fast} and \textit{slow} moving averages).
\end{itemize}
